The ATM system uses high-speed transmission (155 Mbps) and is a connection-based system. When an ATM circuit is established, a patch through multiple switches is setup and remains in place until the connection is completed. ATM service was developed to allow one communication medium (high speed packet data) to provide for voice, data and video service. As of the 1990's, ATM has become a standard for high-speed digital backbone networks. ATM networks are widely used by large telecommunications service providers to interconnect their network parts (e.g. DSLAMs and Routers). ATM aggregators operate networks that consolidate data traffic from multiple feeders (such as DSL lines and ISP links) to transport different types of media (voice, data and video).</td><td>

There are two types of switched trunks usually for lease by a local phone company --ground start and loop-start. PBXs work best on ground start trunks, though many will work--albeit intermittently --on both types. Normal single line phones and key systems typically work on loop-start lines. You must be cautious to order the correct type of trunk from your local phone company and correctly install your telephone system at your end so that they both match. In technical language, a ground start trunk initiates an out-going trunk seizure by applying a maximum local resistance of 550 ohms to the tip conductor. Method used to signal the central office that the calling party has gone offâ€‘hook. Battery is placed on the tip side of line by switching system in the central office. When ground is placed on line at the telephone, the path has been completed through ground.</td></tr>

LVD versions of SCSI allow less than 25 m cable length not because of the lower voltage, but because these SCSI standards allow much higher speeds than the older HVD SCSI.
